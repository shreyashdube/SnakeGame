# SnakeGame
Classic Snake Game
Project Description
This project is a classic Snake game developed using Java Swing and AWT. The game is built step-by-step from scratch, demonstrating how to design the game board, handle user input, implement snake movement, and incorporate collision detection.

Features
User Interface: Built with Java Swing and AWT, providing a simple and intuitive interface for playing the game.
Snake Movement: The snake can be controlled using the keyboard arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.
Food Items: The snake grows in length each time it eats food, which appears randomly on the game board.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, ending the game when a collision occurs.
Game Over Screen: A game over screen is displayed when the player loses, showing the final length of the snake.
Technologies Used
Core Java: Utilizes core Java concepts and libraries.
Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
Java AWT: Used for event handling and rendering graphics.
Object-Oriented Programming: Incorporates OOP principles for structuring the game logic.
